# footballChampionship

This is an Angular Web Application that allows users to consult the 2018-2019 A League Championship board.

By accessing the homepage -that displays the daily stats of matches starting from the last day- and clicking on the single match users can access the detail page of that specific match and see some statistics -free version-.

Using the arrows, users can move from a day to another.

By clicking on teams, users can access the teams detail page that displays features, performances and members of the selected team.

This project includes just three components ("tabellone", "match" and "squad"), two services ("match-service" and "match-list-service").

It uses just two http requests: one to display the Championship day and one to display teams' infos.
